            <div>According to the data, students are really just in the middle range where they are confident or not on themselves. From 1-10, it is approximately at 6 (average) , which is not that bad since they are at least confident. This also suggests that the students have varying perceptions of their own abilities.</div>

            <div>When it comes to academic performances, the students are doing well in their academics. It shows that the students really take this seriously which is really nice because this school is a science high school, which is stereotypically seen as a school with a lot of smart students (which is not). It also shows that most of the students who were confident in themselves, got a really good grade.</div>

            <div>The third quarter grade data offers insight into academic progress over time. It's clear that students' grades varied during this period, but the dataset doesn't immediately reveal the causes of these variations. Future research could explore factors impacting academic performance quarterly, such as study habits, environmental influences, and learning environments.</div>

            <div>The fourth quarter grade data, much like the third quarter data, sheds light on academic progress over time. While it's evident that student grades fluctuated during this quarter, the underlying reasons for these variations aren't immediately apparent. Subsequent studies in this area could delve deeper into the contributors to academic success and how individuals' self-perceptions influence their performance. This study serves as an introductory step in exploring the connection between academic achievement and self-confidence.</div>
